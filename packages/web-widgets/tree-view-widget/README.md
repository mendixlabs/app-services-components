> See test-project [https://treeview-react-sandbox.mxapps.io/](https://treeview-react-sandbox.mxapps.io/) for a live demo! The test-project itself can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/JelteMX/widget-test-projects#tree-view)

> Missing features? See TODO at the bottom to see which items are still on the TODO list. If you find other bugs, please report this as an issue [here](https://github.com/JelteMX/mendix-tree-table/issues)

## Features

- Display a tree structure in a tree view
- Data Sources: XPath, Microflow, Nanoflow
- Load a complete tree structure
- Two patterns: Node-Parent or Node-Children
- Load children over reference, xpath or nanoflow
- On Click events
- Drag &amp; Drop (Node-Parent)
- **Experimental** Client side search (Only on loading a complete tree)

> This widget is about 300Kb uncompressed, so in your cloud deployment this widget should take about 83 Kb of network resources

Tested:

- IE11 & Edge
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

## Basic Configuration

### 1. Data Source

![settings](/assets/settings1.png)

![settings](/assets/settings3.png)


### 4. UI

![settings](/assets/settings4.png)

- Note: You can now also set the class name of a node with an attribute

### 5. Drag & Drop

![settings](/assets/settings5.png)

- Drag &amp; Drop is only enabled for objects with a parent relation
- The widget will do the changes on the object by itself

### 6. Experimental - Search

![settings](/assets/settings6.png)

- This feature is highly experimental and might be subject to change in future releases
- It requires another helper entity, which will be used in calling a Nanoflow
- The helper entity has a reference set of all the objects that are loaded, and the search query. It is up to you to create a Nanoflow that returns a list of objects to be shown (act as a filter)

### 7. Events

## Demo project

[https://treeview-react-sandbox.mxapps.io/](https://treeview-react-sandbox.mxapps.io/)

### Domain model

![domain](/assets/domain.png)

- This is an example of the domain model used in our test-project
- **Note: Only use one type of relation! Either Node-Parent or Node-Children!** This domain model features both, as cwe reate two types of sets of nodes to show all capabilities
