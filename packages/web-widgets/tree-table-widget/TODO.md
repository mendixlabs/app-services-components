## TODO

This is a list of todo's working on features

- Toolbar:
  - Expand/Collapse all
- Load complete tree all at once (for small structures). Should already be possible, but need to set internal parent/children keys on complete retrieval
- Fixed column on the left
- Setting width (this should be done through CSS)
- Fixed header (initial tests make it unusable because the header and content widths are out of sync)
